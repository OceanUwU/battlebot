        <p>Survive to the end!<br />Battlebot is a Discord bot based on based on <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1017744">Tank Turn Tactics</a>.<br /><b>2-25 players</b></p>

        <h2>RULES</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All players start at a random location on the grid, and have 3 hearts and 1 action point (AP).</li>
            <li>At a set interval, everyone will receive 1 AP.</li>
            <li>At any time you like, you can spend AP to perform any of the following actions:
                <ul>
                    <li>MOVE to an adjacent, unoccupied square (1 AP).</li>
                    <li>SHOOT someone who is within your range (1 AP). Shooting someone removes 1 heart from their health.</li>
                    <li>HEAL for one heart (3 AP). There is no limit to your hearts.</li>
                    <li>UPGRADE your range (3 AP), up to 20.</li>
                    <li>GIFT a heart or action point to anyone within range (1 HP or 1 AP). This transfers one of your hearts or AP to the other player.</li>
                    <li>PUSH another player within your range in any direction (1 AP).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>At the start of the game, everyone has a range of 2. That is, they can SHOOT at or GIFT to anyone within 2 squares of them. Upgrading your shooting range increases this by 1 square each time.</li>
            <li>If a player is reduced to 0 hearts, then they are dead. Any action points the dead player had are transferred to the player who killed them. Dead players remain on the board and not removed.</li>
            <li>Dead players form a jury. Each day they vote on a player, and when AP is distributed, players get 1 extra AP for every 3 votes they get from the jury.</li>
            <li>Gifting a heart to a dead player revives them.</li>
            <li>If you gift your last heart to someone, you will die, but your leftover AP will stay on your body, and will be usable if you are revived later.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ADDITIONAL NOTES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Action points are secret! Probably a good idea to try and hide how many you have.</li>
            <li>You can't win this game without making some friends and stabbing some backs. Probably.</li>
        </ul>
